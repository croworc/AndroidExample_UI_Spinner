# AndroidExample_UI_Spinner

A "learning `Android`" project for AndroidStudio, demonstrating Android's
`Spinner` UI widget.
I'm just learning Android, git, GitHub etc., so I'm hosting this
project on GitHub mainly for training purposes. So, no really *useful*
or elaborate app here. However, feel free to look around and maybe even
play with it. Its public, anyway. :smile:


## Installation

AndroidStudio project. No external dependencies.
Clone or download as ZIP and import into AndroidStudio.

Targets Android SDK version 24, so depending on your installation,
you may be prompted to download that SDK version during build.

## Usage

App just demonstrates a few of Android's standard `Spinner` properties.

## Contributing

But, if you really want to:
  1. Fork it!
  2. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
  3. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
  4. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
  5. Submit a pull request :D

  - A very special "Thanks, man!" goes to [Andres Q.](http://stackoverflow.com/users/4556980/andres-q) who has posted a really elegant solution to the dreaded problem that the `onItemSelected()` event was **fired twice** upon device rotation. (see [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560733/spinners-onitemselected-callback-called-twice-after-a-rotation-if-non-zero-posi) stackoverflow.com question).
